        <h1>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. His scientific achievements and popularity gained him the epithets “Missile Man” and “People’s President.”</h1>

</body><h2>In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing Pres. Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam’s stature and popular appeal were such that he was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA despite his being Muslim, and even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the vote of the electoral college, defeating former revolutionary leader Lakshmi Sahgal. He was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.</h2>
